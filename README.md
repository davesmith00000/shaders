# Dave's Shader Reference

> No shader is too trivial.

All shaders written in [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/ultraviolet) and presented running in [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/).

I'm doing this as a learning exercise and to build up a collection of reference material. Some of the code will necessarily be based on / adapted from the work of others. I will endevour to attribute wherever possible, please feel free raise issues if you feel I haven't done a good enough job in any regard.
