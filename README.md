# Dave's Shader Reference

> No shader is too trivial.

Go to [https://davesmith00000.github.io/shaders/](https://davesmith00000.github.io/shaders/) to run the shaders.

All the shaders are written in [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/ultraviolet) and presented running in [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/).

I'm doing this as a learning exercise and to build up a collection of reference material.

Some of the code will necessarily be based on / adapted from the work of others. I will endevour to attribute the original authors (in the code) wherever possible, please feel free raise an issue on the repo if you feel I haven't done a good enough job in this regard.
